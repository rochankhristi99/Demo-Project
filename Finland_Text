Finland is the seventh-largest country in Europe. Finland shares a border with Norway to the east and Sweden to the west. 
The geographical position of Finland has influenced its climate greatly. Due to Finlandâ€™s geographical position, the winter 
is normally very cold and long. People of the Arctic Circle usually experience polar nights, where the nights are longer than the days.
 People around the same region also experience polar days, where the days are longer than the nights. The heavy forestation in Finland 
is also believed to affect the climate experienced in the country. It is estimated that about three-quarters of the land in Finland is covered by trees.
